Miniapplications (Miniapps) are designed to be performance proxies for large scale applications in a variety of situations where use of the full applications are infeasible. These situations include the study of new architectures, programming models and application designs. Thus, miniapps are models of the applications and can be subject to validation studies.

In this workshop on August 23, 2010, we presented an overview of several miniapps, along with a discussion of the related large scale applications and explored opportunities for using miniapps within simulator environments. The presentations from the workshop are available below.

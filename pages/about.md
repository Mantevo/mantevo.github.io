The Mantevo project is an effort to provide open-source software packages for the analysis, prediction and improvement of high performance computing applications.

**Goals for the project include:**

*   Predict performance of real applications in new situations.
*   Aid computer systems design decisions.
*   Foster communication between applications, libraries and computer systems developers.
*   Guide application and library developers in algorithm and software design choices for new systems.
*   Provide open source software to promote informed algorithm, application and architecture decisions in the HPC community.

**Project features:**

*   Miniapplication and minidriver development done by application developers with years of experience.
*   Software available as open source.
*   Application space coverage includes: Implicit unstructured PDE applications, explicit dynamics (contact), molecular dynamics, circuit simulation.
*   Multiple versions of some miniapplications, including MPI, OpenMP, BEC, Qthreads.

## Processes for Contributing to Mantevo: Checklists

The Mantevo manages processes via several checklists. If you are interested in contributing to the project, please carefully review these lists (in MS Word format), especially the first two:

*   [ProposingNewMantevoCodes](pdfs/ProposingNewMantevoCodes.docx) – A process for proposing the addition of a new code to Mantevo.
*   [MantevoReleaseChecklist111714](pdfs/MantevoReleaseChecklist111714.docx) – Release checklist for miniapps and minidrivers. Typically the most time-consuming part of importing a miniapp into Mantevo is adapting to the **_Mantevo common_ _look-and-feel_** guidelines that are part of this checklist.
*   [MantevoReleaseFramework1114](pdfs/MantevoReleaseFramework1114.docx) – Release checklist for release coordinator.

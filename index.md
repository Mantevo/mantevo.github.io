Mantevo is a multi-faceted application performance project. 
It provides application performance proxies known as _**miniapps**._ 
Miniapps combine some or all of the dominant numerical kernels 
contained in an actual stand-alone application. 
Miniapps include libraries wrapped in a test driver providing representative inputs. 
They may also be hard-coded to solve a particular test case so as to 
simplify the need for parsing input files and mesh descriptions. 
Mini apps range in scale from partial, performance-coupled components of the application 
to a simplified representation of a complete execution path through the application.

Mantevo pioneered the concept of using miniapps as the central element in co-design efforts 
for next-generation scalable computers and applications. 
Mantevo received a 2013 R&D 100 award and an FLC Regional Technology Transfer award.

The Mantevo Project puts out annual releases of the Mantevo Miniapp Suite 
prior to each US Supercomputing Conference in November.

## Mantevo Virtual Machine

A [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) virtual machine preloaded with the proxy apps 
featured at the SC12 Proxy App Tutorial is 
[available for download](tutorial.html). 
Using the virtual machine is perhaps the simplest way to try some of the Mantevo proxy apps 
for the first time. VirtualBox runs on Linux, Mac, or Windows.

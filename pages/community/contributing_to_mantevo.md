We provide two primary mechanisms for contributing to Mantevo:

1.  Develop or import a new miniapp into the Mantevo Project. This process is carried out by following the checklists on the [Mantevo Developer Tools](http://mantevo.org/community/developer-tools/ "Developer Tools") page.
2.  Send a message to [mantevo-developers@mantevo.org](mailto:mantevo-developers@mantevo.org "mantevo-developers@mantevo.org") to request consideration for the mantevo.org site to host a website link to your independent miniapp. We are happy to help improve visibility of miniapps that are consistent and complementary to existing Mantevo miniapps.

The Mantevo Project welcomes contributions from new developers, 
but we ask that you complete and submit a contributor agreement. 
There are two versions of the agreement, 
one for [individuals](http://mantevo.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mantevo-individual-contributor-agreement-v02.doc), 
and one for [corporations](http://mantevo.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/mantevo-corporate-contributor-agreement-v02.doc). Please look at both to determine which is right for you.

If you are thinking about contributing, you may want to subscribe to our [mail lists](http://mantevo.org/community/mail-lists/ "Mail Lists").

Mantevo packages are designed to be used in many different system environments, 
but are especially meant to be usable in new system environments such as simulators and 
new architecture systems. As a result, Mantevo packages:

* Are self-contained and rely on simple, manual build processes.
* Use a stable core subset of the language (C, C++, Fortran, etc.) used by applications in the domain of interest.
* Are small so that they can be easily understood, and even rewritten in new languages.
